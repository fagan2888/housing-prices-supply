Hi Miriam, here's some wrap-up info!

Sam, what we've done is implement a master set of data filtering procedures on the sales transactions. There's info here and on Github.

Database changes
The filtered sales transactions are copied into a new table on the database server. This turned out to be smoother to implement than adding new columns to the existing table.

Documentation
The final Word document is attached. I also added some documentation on Github along with my code.

https://github.com/ual/dataquick/blob/master/ucb_documentation/data_processing.md (last section)

Updated stats tables
I'm attaching some updated stats tables:
- residential sale counts by year and tract
- median price per square foot by year and tract, divided into single-fam and multi-fam

Sam, would it be possible to update the flips too? Miriam had asked about this.

Updated data extracts
And finally, i regenerated the CSV extracts and uploaded them to Box under sales/v3.

Let me know if you have any questions, or if there are pieces i missed!

Cheers,
Sam
